Note: If you want to use features like login or registration, you need to run the backend first.

## Build the Backend Server

1. Start a Django project:

```
django-admin startproject myproject
```

2. Copy important files to your project management folder:

- `settings.py`

- `game`
- `Rating`
- `shopping`
- `Userapp`

4. Copy app files into the app folder:

- `view.py`
- `model.py`

5. Modify `settings.py` to connect the database and project name:

- Add the project name to `INSTALLED_APPS`
- Modify `DATABASE` to your account
- Modify the email sending part to your account
- Modify `MEDIA_ROOT` to your account

6. Build the database:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
7. Clone RWKV model for chatbot:
	
- in your project file
- git clone https://github.com/BlinkDL/ChatRWKV.git
- change file in RWKV project/v2/chat.py
